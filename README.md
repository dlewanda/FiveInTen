# FiveInTen

A fun party game where the player must name five items in the specified category within ten seconds.

Inspired by the [Preston and Steve Morning Show](http://www.prestonandsteve.com) on [WMMR](http://www.wmmr.com) in Philadelphia

This is still in early development, mostly as an Android programming exercise.
